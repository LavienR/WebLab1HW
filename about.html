        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p class="Introduction">
          MyPhoto Gallery is a curated platform that showcases high-quality
          photography — from landscapes to cityscape, everyday moments to
          artistic captures. Whether you're here to explore, get inspired, or
          find visuals for your projects, MyPhoto Gallery makes beautiful
          imagery easily accessible.
        </p>

              <h2 id="purpose-h">Our Purpose</h2>
              <p>
                The goal of MyPhoto Gallery is to create a space where visual
                creativity truly connects with the people who appreciate it. We
                want every photo to be more than just something you scroll past
                — it should say something, make you pause, maybe even inspire
                you. Whether it's a quiet moment, a bold idea, or a playful
                experiment, every image deserves room to breathe. That's why we
                keep things clean and distraction-free, so you can explore at
                your own pace and enjoy photography the way it was meant to be
                experienced.

              <p>
                MyPhoto Gallery began as a small passion project, born from a
                love of capturing moments and exploring the art of visual
                storytelling. Over time, it has evolved into both a personal
                gallery and a growing resource hub for photography enthusiasts.
                Though currently run by a single creator, the long-term vision
                is to transform it into a collaborative space — a community
                where photographers and visual storytellers can share their
                work, exchange ideas, and inspire one another.
